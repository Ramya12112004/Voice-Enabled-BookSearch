# 🔍📚 Voice Enabled Book Search System using Python & ML

This project is a **Voice-Enabled Intelligent Book Search System** built using **Python**, **Speech Recognition**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and basic **Machine Learning** techniques. The system allows users to search for books using their voice commands.

## 🎯 Objective

To build an accessible and intelligent system that allows users to search for books by speaking, making book discovery faster, user-friendly, and inclusive.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Search books using voice commands.
- 🧠 **NLP-Powered Search**: Understands natural language queries.
- 📚 **Book Database**: Search within a local or online book dataset.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Enhance search relevance using keyword extraction or classification (optional).
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech** (TTS): Provides audio responses for search results (optional).
- 📈 **Scalable**: Can be extended to large datasets or online APIs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- SpeechRecognition (Google Speech API)
- gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Pandas / SQLite (for book data)
- Scikit-learn (for ML, optional)
- NLTK or spaCy (for NLP processing)
